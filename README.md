## üßÆ Stat Calculation Architecture
Player attributes are computed using a centralized **Total Aggregator** system:
1. **Extensible API**: Provides interfaces/abstract classes for plugins to implement custom **Sub-Aggregators**
2. **Attribute Compilation**:
    - Total Aggregator collects data from all registered Sub-Aggregators
    - Sums values from all contributors
    - Updates cached player attributes
3. **Event-Driven Updates**:
    - Triggers `AttributeUpdateEvent` containing:
        - Player instance
        - Full attribute bundle
    - Allows attribute listeners to dynamically update player state (movement speed, health, etc.)
4. **Dynamic Synchronization**: Enables custom listeners to react to real-time stat changes
